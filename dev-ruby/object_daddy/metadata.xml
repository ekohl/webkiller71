Object Daddy is a library (as well as a Ruby on Rails plugin) designed to assist
in automating testing of large collections of objects, especially webs of
ActiveRecord models. It is a descendent of the "Object Mother" pattern for
creating objects for testing, and is related to the concept of an "object
exemplar" or stereotype.
